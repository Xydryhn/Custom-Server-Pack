			"text": "A $(thing)Steam Dynamo$() has a $(thing)fuel slot$() and a $(thing)water tank$(). When fuel is placed in its $(thing)fuel slot$() and the $(thing)water tank$() is filled with water, the dynamo will start consuming both to generate Redstone Flux. Every unit of fuel yields a certain amount of energy when consumed. Water is consumed in batches of 100 mB to generate 25,000 RF at a time."

			"text": "The speed at which energy is generated and fuel is consumed depends on how much power can be emitted, and on the dynamo's maximum power output. A basic steam dynamo has a maximum power output of 40 RF/t. This can be increased by upgrading the dynamo to a higher tier, and by installing certain augments."
