Whether you intend to just get started with a couple simple machines or need an entire base powered, a variety of options exists to generate power. Note that in this entry, only RF power will be discussed; see other mods' manuals for other incompatible forms of power."

			"text": "In the event that you don't mind to crank by hand, you can create a $(bold)$(item)Clockwork Engine$() relatively cheaply (4 copper ingots, 4 gold ingots, 2 redstone, 1 iron). Right-click the engine to wind it up.$(p)The $(bold)$(item)Biogas Engine$() can burn organic materials, such as fruit juice, liquid biomass, seed oil or liquid honey. It does however need lava in its secondary tank to heat up."

The $(l:mods_thermalexpansion/magmatic_dynamo)$(bold)$(item)Magmatic Dynamo$() can generate energy from lava. The $(l:mods_thermalexpansion/compression_dynamo)$(bold)$(item)Compression Dynamo$() can do so from liquid fuel such as Seed oil, Crude Oil, Naptha or Refined Fuel."

			"type": "text",
			"text": "The $(l:mods_thermalexpansion/reactant_dynamo)$(bold)$(item)Reactant Dynamo$() generates fuel with specific combinations of fuel and reactant to generate energy. For instance, 100 millibuckets of $(item)Blazing Pyrotheum$() and one $(item)Cryotheum Dust$() generates 400 000 RF. $(l:mods_thermalexpansion/enervation_dynamo)$(bold)$(item)Enervation Dynamos$() can convert redstone into energy (64 000 RF / redstone or 640 000 RF / redstone block) or can drain items that contain energy. And if you're into exotic power sources, a $(l:mods_thermalexpansion/numismatic_dynamo)$(bold)$(item)Numismatic Dynamo$() is even able to generate energy from coins and gems!"

The $(bold)$(item)Thermoelectric Generator$() can passively generate power using a hot and cold liquid on either side. If you need something bigger, a $(bold)$(item)Diesel Engine$() is a large multiblock generator which generates 4096 RF/t from $(item)Biodiesel$()."

The $(bold)$(thing)Leaf-Eating Generator$() equally produces green energy at 350 RF per consumed leaf block. You don't care about nature? Fresh Minecraft air is infinite, so you can still use a $(bold)$(item)Coal Generator$() (30 RF/t) or $(bold)$(item)Oil Generator$() producing 40-350 RF/t depending on the fuel provided."

The $(bold)$(item)Combustion Generator$() takes liquid fuels instead to generate 60-160 RF/t depending on the fuel (or the $(bold)$(item)Enhanced Combustion Engine$(), which has double performance)."
